    <h2>Visualization</h2>
    <p class="note">
      Music metrics are computed from Billboard Hot 100 weekly charts (1958–2024). Political polarization is computed
      from Voteview DW-NOMINATE party means. The 1950s include only 1958–1959; the 2020s include 2020–mid 2024.
      This visualization highlights correlations and temporal convergence rather than claiming direct causality.

    <h2>Method (short)</h2>
    <p>
      This project compares decade-level music chart dynamics with a standardized measure of U.S. political polarization.
      Music metrics are aggregated from weekly Hot 100 rankings, while polarization is derived from party mean ideology
      scores (DW-NOMINATE). The visualization supports exploratory analysis and does not claim direct causality.

    <h2>Important limitations</h2>
    <p>
      The Hot 100 starts in 1958, so the 1950s decade is partial (1958–1959). The 2020s decade is also partial (2020–mid 2024),
      which may bias longevity metrics downward due to right-censoring.
